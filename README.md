This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This app allows users to find a list of users based on the search input. Once users are found based on that search input you are allowed to click the user to find all pictures of that user. If no pictures are found then
a message of no images found is displayed. If no users is found then a message of no users are found appears. This application was divided into three components in the app component. The PhotoGrid, Footer, and UserListArea component. All the state was managed in the app component and passed down through props.
